# Identifying-nationality-emotion-from-images
In this project, first with the help of UTKFace dataset I trained model for age and nationality detection. For emotion detection I used FER 2013 dataset. Accordingly, for US nationality : predicted emotions,age; African : emotions,dress color; Indian : emotions,age & Dress color; Others: just emotions & nationality. For Dress Color, I used simple KNN clustering on the bottom part of the image assuming maximum color to be identified there.
